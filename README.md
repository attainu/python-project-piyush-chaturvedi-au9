Junk File Organizer with Python
Basically, as a lazy programmer my desktop is full of files (Junk Files). Due to the large number of files, it is a daunting task to sit and organize each file. To make that task easy the below Python script comes handy and all the files are organized in a well-manner within seconds.
•	for using without any outside library installed, download this file and use it
Main functionality of this code
•	Organize by extension
How to use this::
For Organize with extension
Just paste the exe file or python file in target folder then run.
Organize by extension
by using this option user can organize their files by their file extension in a given folder, folder will be created according to file extension and finally all files will be moved to a created folder.
what i used :
I used many built-in libraries like- os for file movement the command line parsing.
future improvement:
We can design the ui for the program so a normal user can easily interact with it. We can add more features like deleting the junk files after a certain period of time, organize with date and size.
